VS Code Extensions – Setup Guide
This guide lists the essential VS Code extensions for Python development, container management, Kubernetes, and convenience tools. It is beginner-friendly and helps you quickly set up your environment.

1️⃣ Python & Development
Extension	Publisher	Purpose
Python	Microsoft	Syntax highlighting, linting, debugging, virtual environment support
Pylance	Microsoft	Type checking, IntelliSense, and code suggestions
Jupyter (optional)	Microsoft	Run Jupyter notebooks directly in VS Code

Tip: Python is mandatory. Install Pylance for smarter code suggestions. Jupyter is optional, only if you plan to run notebooks.

2️⃣ Container & Kubernetes
Extension	Publisher	Purpose
Docker	Microsoft	Build and manage Docker containers and Dockerfiles
Kubernetes	Microsoft	Run kubectl commands, browse clusters, and manage manifests
Helm	Microsoft	Support for Helm charts and templates

Tip: YAML is important for Kubernetes manifests and configuration files. GitLens helps you understand Git history more easily.

4️⃣ Optional / Convenience Tools
Extension	Publisher	Purpose
Better Comments	Aaron Bond	Highlight TODOs, NOTES, and WARNINGS in code
REST Client	Huachao Mao	Test APIs directly from VS Code without external tools
Material Icon Theme	PKief	Makes file icons visually intuitive and organized

Tip: These tools are optional but improve productivity and code readability.

5️⃣ Optional (for Codespaces users)
Extension	Publisher	Purpose
GitHub Codespaces	Microsoft	Connect and develop directly in GitHub Codespaces

Tip: Only needed if you plan to use GitHub Codespaces instead of a local environment.

✅ Pro Tip for Beginners: Install extensions one by one, and after installation, reload VS Code to enable them. Check the bottom-right corner of VS Code to confirm each extension is active.
